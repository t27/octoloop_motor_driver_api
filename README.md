# Roboteq-Linux-API

This is a branch of the Roboteq Linux API (http://www.roboteq.com/index.php/support/downloads) for the Roboteq NxtGen Series of Motor Controllers. After my own difficulties with the API, some forum posts and telephone conversations with Roboteq support, my conclusion is that there are some serious problems with the API as it currently is and this is my attempt to get it working.
